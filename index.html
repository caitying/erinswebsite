        <h1>WHAT IS COACHING AND<br>WHAT IS LIFE COACHING?</h1>
        <p>
          Coaching is a form of development in which an experienced person called a “coach”, supports a learner or
          client in achieving a specific personal or professional goal by providing training and guidance to the
          “coachee” or “client”. It’s a process used to
          transport people from where they are to where they want to be. It’s a process of learning where an individual
          takes guidance and support from an experienced person (the coach) and seeks to maximize the client’s
          potential. The objective of coaching is to
          help a client achieve their goals both personal and work related. Coaching prepares an individual for
          self-accountability and empowers a person who is seeking professional development and assistance.
        </p>

      <p class="main-para">
        The benefits of coaching are many including empowering the client to have a greater sense of responsibility,
        promoting effective <br> communication, empowering people with
        decision making skills and improving their productivity and work performance. When a <br>person is being
        coaches, they are not only aught more about a subject but are also
        empowered to make their own decisions <br>and assumes complete responsibility for their actions. This keeps the
        person engaged and productive, boosting their personal <br>and
        professional development.
        <br><br>
        Coaches use a variety of skills such as targeted restatements, listening, questioning, clarifying to help
        clients shift their perspectives and therefore discover different
        approaches to achieve their goals. A good coach offers a supportive environment for the learner and helps them
        achieve their full potential by extending support and
        encouragement, and avoiding judgement and telling the client what to do or giving them answers.
        <br><br>
        A coach has many similarities to a mentor or a teacher except that the role of a coach is more holistic. A coach
        is an expert in their field, and helps the client or individual in
        bringing out their full potential by themselves. A coach not only educates their client but also equips them
        with excellent life skills like confidence building, communication skills,
        and passion. A coach offers feedback on the client’s progress and growth. A good coach helps you get excellent
        results. Along with assessments, quizzes, questionnaires and regular
        challenges, this will help the client get out of their comfort zone and experiment with new things to achieve
        their goals. Ultimately the coach is a guide, mentor and teacher allowing
        the client to come up with their own agenda, plan, answers and direction to live their best and full potential
        lives.

      <p style="margin-left: 5rem; margin-right: 35rem; text-align: right;">
        Overall, a Retirement Coach can help you be mentally, spiritually and emotionally prepared for what happens when your career ends. Retirement comes with opportunity, change and uncertainty. 
        A Retirement Coach can help you get clear about what kind of retirement you want and how to get there as fast and as smoothly as possible. Ideally you should begin working with a coach a 
        few years prior to retirement, so your plan is in place. If you’re already retired and find yourself in need of some support and guidance, it’s never too late to benefit from a coach’s 
        expertise. Retirement is a very large transition, and it can be a hugely different lifestyle from what you previously experienced. Retirement Coaching focuses on everything except the 
        financial side.

        feel right and then help implement a plan of action to where they want to
        get to and where they want to be. A Retirement Coach can help you create a plan for well-being. Explore new
